<!--#echo json="package.json" key="description" -->
Advanced GitHub CI workflows for vrana&#39;s Adminer, the nice database
management and editing tool.
<!--/#echo -->


Motivation
----------

[Adminer](https://github.com/vrana/adminer/) is my favorite database
management and editing tool.
One day, I wanted to compile my own variation of it,
but I didn't want to install all the tools on my dev machine.
I'd rather have automatic build-and-release in the GitHub CI.



Usage
-----

:TODO:




Known issues
------------

* Needs more/better tests and docs.
